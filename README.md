# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of Air Quality Index (AQI)

## Description
This project demonstrates how to perform time series analysis, visualization, and forecasting on a dataset containing Air Quality Index (AQI) data. Using Python and the `statsmodels` library, it includes techniques such as:
- Plotting AQI trends over time.
- Analyzing autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF).
- Differencing the data to achieve stationarity.
- Forecasting AQI values using the **SARIMAX** model.

## Features
1. Data preprocessing:
   - Removing missing values using forward fill.
   - Preparing the data for time series analysis.
2. Visualization:
   - Line plots for AQI trends.
   - Lagged comparisons for AQI values.
   - ACF and PACF plots to understand time series structure.
3. Forecasting:
   - Implementation of the SARIMAX model.
   - Customizable ARIMA and seasonal orders.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required:
- `pandas` (Data manipulation)
- `numpy` (Numerical computations)
- `matplotlib` (Visualization)
- `statsmodels` (Time series modeling)
- `warnings` (Suppress warnings)

Install the libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels
```
### Good luck
